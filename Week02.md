# Colorspace

The range of colors that can be represented in a color model coordinate system, which is generally expressed as a combination of three primary colors: red, green, and blue.

The human eye is the most comprehensive color space because it can detect various colors that the electronic device cannot copy. In practice, internationally standardized International Lighting Commission (CIE) chromaticity diagrams developed for efficient color image processing are mainly used. It refers to a range of colors reproduced by a monitor or a printer, and has the same meaning as a range of colors.
