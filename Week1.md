# What is 2D?

말 그대로 두 개의 차원이 존재함을 의미한다. 쉽게 말해 x축과 y축이 존재하는 평면상태라고 할 수 있다. 

# What is Dimension?

: 그 공간에 있는 점의 위치를 표시하는 데 필요한 실수의 최소 개수 

So we can call 0 dimension just a dot.

## Then why we use 2D?

We confront many different kinds of shapes and dimensions in our world. 

And to create 3 dimension and even 4 dimension, we need 2D to consist the points that are parallel to each other. 

Most of all, our almost every output of works will come out in 2 Dimensioned way. That’s why we can’t lose 2 dimension while working in graphic or some other works. 

## DIGIT-AL

- Digit :

「손발의 하나 하나의 가락」이라는 의미로부터 파생된 단어. 

한 자리의 정수를 표시하는 도형 문자 any of the Arabic numerals 1 to 9 and usually the symbol 0

- Al :

adjective_ something made of number~

of, relating to, or characterized by

# What is Compositing?

Compositing is the process through which two or more images combine to make the appearance of a single picture. The composite process can be done on-set and in-camera or during Post-Production. There are dozens of different ways to composite shots but perhaps the most common example is when a weatherman is placed in front of a green screen with the weather details behind them.

# What is COLOR?

There are two types of color that we can call color. 

### RGB

: three primary color in light(Red, Green, Blue)

the color space for digital images 

A light source within a device creates any color you need by mixing red, green and blue and varying their intensity. 

This is known as **additive mixing**: all colors begin as black darkness and then red, green and blue light is *added* on top of each other to brighten it and create the perfect pigment.

### CMYK

: four primary color(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key)

A printing machine creates images by combining CMYK colors to varying degrees with physical ink. 

This is known as **subtractive mixing**. All colors start as blank white, and each layer of ink *reduces* the initial brightness to create the preferred color. When all colors are mixed together, they create pure black.

# Alpha channel

Additional channels set up in the default channel to make image processing easier and more effective in computer applications. The 32-bit graphics system has a total of four channels, three channels each consisting of eight bits and one additional channel consisting of eight bits, used when the image is in RGB (red, green, and blue) mode. 

This additional channel is called an alpha channel. Alpha channels effectively fuse the two colors when the colors of one pixel on the graphic overlap the colors of another pixel, and are very effective in animation work.
